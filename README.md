# gmock_boilerplate_with_cmake
C++ CMock boilerplate with CMake and Docker
Use this project as starting point for projects using GMock and GTest
Use Docker as a reference for how to setup Google Test and Google Mock on Linux machines.
Don't use older CMake as won't properly support GMock, maybe use pgk-config instead?
